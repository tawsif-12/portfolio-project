    longDescription: "Proud to showcase ঘুষপোকা (CorruptionWatch) with my team Broliers at the Intra AUST Software Exhibition. We built a comprehensive platform where anyone can safely submit corruption reports, track their cases with a unique ID, and analyze trends through an interactive dashboard. The platform prioritizes user privacy and transparency, allowing users to monitor their submitted cases and view corruption trends across different sectors. With GSAP animations for smooth interactions, Locomotive Scroll for enhanced scrolling experience, and Chart.js for data visualization, we focused on making the experience smooth, transparent, and user-friendly. Users can even export case records as PDFs for documentation purposes. The project received inspiring feedback from judges who appreciated the privacy-first approach, the reassurance of the tracking system, and the clean, responsive UI. They also encouraged us to think bigger by adding multi-language support, real-time chat, NGO partnerships, and even blockchain and AI to strengthen security and detect fake reports. Developed in collaboration with my amazing teammates Syed Mohammed Sazid Ullah and Irfan Zahir.",
